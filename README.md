# Ziyuan's Origami Page

Welcome to my origami gallery! Here, I've showcased some of my favourite Origami creations. While I've folded these pieces, the designs are credited to their respective creators. I won't be providing the diagrams due to copyright issues.

## A Lazy Bear, based on Quentin Trollip's Grizzly Bear

This origami bear was inspired by a photograph I took during a zoo visit. Quentin Trollip originally crafted the design, and I created this piece as a tribute to capture the likeness of the real bear, as seen on the right. The resemblance is striking, don't you think?

## Unicorn, designed by Kyohei Katsuta

Out of the unicorns I've folded, Kyohei Katsuta's design stands out as the most elegant. While I was still perfecting my skills with tissue-foil paper, the chest area didn't turn out as I'd hoped. But the result is still a sight to behold.

## Unicorn, designed by Kamiya Satoshi

Kamiya Satoshi's unicorn design is a challenging one to execute well. After three attempts, I achieved the look you see here. I'd initially planned to craft one using tissue foil paper, but time constraints got in the way.

## Unicorn, designed by Oriol Esteve

Oriol Esteve's unicorn is as adorable as it is simple to fold. It's an excellent project for those looking to practice their skills with tissue-foil paper, yielding a cute result every time.
